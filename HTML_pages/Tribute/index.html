        <li>According to official Temple accounts, Nerevar was the Hortator and leader of the Chimer. Featured prominently in the negotiations for the creation of the First Council and the united kingdom of Resdayn (now known as Morrowind), he was a friend of the Dwemer leader, Dumac.</li>
        <li>When the War of Succesion crippled the Nordic Empire, Nerevar took his chance. The Dwemer and Chimer joined forces, and rose in rebellion against the Nords. In 1E 146, the Chimeri and Dwemeri forces defeated the Nordic armies, and drove them out of Morrowind.</li>
        <li>Nerevar and Dumac ruled over Morrowind in peace for a long time, relying on their friendship. But as many of Nerevar's councillers predicted, the peace wouldn't last. Voryn Dagoth, better known as Dagoth Ur, found out that the Dwemer High Priest Kagrenac was using the Heart of Lorkhan to build a new God, the Numidium. The Chimeri people took this as blasphemy against their Gods. When Nerevar confronted his friend Dumac abou the matter, the First Council broke down. Some say that it was all a big misunderstanding and Dumac did not know about the Numidium, although this isn't known for certain.</li>
        <li>The Dwemer forces with their constructs where undoubtibly the most fearsome millitary force in all of Tamriel, but after numberous defeats, the Chimeri armies where able to launch an attack on Red Mountain.

After a long battle with many casualties, Nerevar, the Tribunal and Voryn Dagoth managed to enter the Red Mountain. The battle resulted in Nerevar's death, and the dissapearance of the entire Dwemer race.</li>
        <li>What exactly happened at Red Mountain remains a mystery, although there are many different accounts on the matter.

The Tribunal Temple states that Nerevar and Azura made the Dwemer dissapear, and how Nerevar died by wounds inflicted by Dumac and possibly Dagoth Ur.

The Ashlanders believe that the Tribunal, hunger for the Heart's power, poisoned the wounds of Nerevar so they could claim the Heart of Lorkhan for themselves.</li>
