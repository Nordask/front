    <h4>Features</h4>
    <p>The shape (geometry) of swords varies extensively and the creation of a typology which attempts to capture all the possible types seems to be impossible. Features added to the shaper, for purposes of function or esthetics, are another significant factor in classification.  Nevertheless, students of sword design often look to certain general physical attributes when describing edged weapons.  In this section we are referring only to the blade itself.</p>

  <div id="cut">
    <h4>How it cuts</h4>
    <p>The cut-and-thrust sword has long held a great deal of fascination for students of weaponry. Although possessing a radical profile taper suitable for thrusting, the sword's blade is still broad enough to allow effective cuts. A result of this arrangement is that the blade design, balance, and weight required to use cuts are different from those that make an ideal thrusting sword. By "sitting the fence" this design neither cuts nor thrusts as effectively as other styles that choose one function exclusively. This disadvantage may be one of the reasons why other sword types replaced these hybrid weapons. Broadswords like the Scottish basket hilts and Schiavona hilts as battle swords and rapiers and smallswords for civilian wear.
