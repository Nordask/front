JS Data types:
undefined
null
boolean
	Boolean values are never written with quotes. The strings "true" and "false" are not Boolean and have no special meaning in JavaScript.
string
symbol
number
object
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Variables
Variables are case sensitive.
Best Practice
Write variable names in JavaScript in camelCase. In camelCase, multi-word variable names have the first word in lowercase 
and the first letter of each subsequent word is capitalized.

Declare variable:
	var ourName; - creates a variable called ourName
	When JavaScript variables are declared, they have an initial value of undefined.
	If you do a mathematical operation on an undefined variable your result will be NaN which means "Not a Number".
	If you concatenate a string with an undefined variable, you will get a literal string of "undefined".
Assigment variable:
	myVariable = 5;
	
Not all real numbers can accurately be represented in floating point. This can lead to rounding errors.
Everything to the right of the equals sign is evaluated first.

Escape sequences
\'	single quote
\"	double quote
\\	backslash
\n	newline
\r	carriage return
\t	tab
\b	backspace
\f	form feed

Concatenate String:
'My name is Alan,' + ' I concatenate.'

lastName.lenght - string lenght
lastName[0] - number of character 

String values are immutable, which means that they cannot be altered once created.


In JavaScript, scope refers to the visibility of variables. Variables which are defined outside of a function block have Global scope. 
This means, they can be seen everywhere in your JavaScript code.

Variables which are used without the var keyword are automatically created in the global scope. 
This can create unintended consequences elsewhere in your code or when running a function again. You should always declare your variables with var.
It is possible to have both local and global variables with the same name. When you do this, the local variable takes precedence over the global variable.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Arrays
Declaration:
var sandwich = ["peanut butter", "jelly", "bread"]
Multi-dimensional Array:
[["Bulls", 23], ["White Sox", 45]]

Add element to array:
arr.push(4); - end
.unshift() - start
Remove last element from array:
ourArray.pop();
Remove first element from array:
.shift()

filter()
The filter() method creates an array filled with all array elements that pass a test (provided as a function).

map()
The map() method creates a new array with the results of calling a function for every array element.
------------------------------------
Remove element with splice
splice() - can take up to 3 parameters
The first two parameters of splice() are integers which represent indexes, or positions, of the array that splice() is being called upon.
first parameter represents the index on the array from which to begin removing elements, while the second parameter indicates the number of elements to delete.

let array = ['today', 'was', 'not', 'so', 'great'];

array.splice(2, 2);
// remove 2 elements beginning with the 3rd element
// array now equals ['today', 'was', 'great']

splice() not only modifies the array it's being called on, but it also returns a new array containing the value of the removed elements:

let array = ['I', 'am', 'feeling', 'really', 'happy'];

let newArray = array.splice(3, 2);
// newArray equals ['really', 'happy']

Add item with splice
function colorChange(arr, index, newColor) {
  arr.splice(index, 1, newColor);
  return arr;
}

let colorScheme = ['#878787', '#a08794', '#bb7e8c', '#c9b6be', '#d1becf'];

colorScheme = colorChange(colorScheme, 2, '#332327');
// we have removed '#bb7e8c' and added '#332327' in its place
// colorScheme now equals ['#878787', '#a08794', '#332327', '#c9b6be', '#d1becf']
---------------------------------
Copy Array Items Using slice()
modifying an array, copies, or extracts, a given number of elements to a new array, leaving the array it is called upon untouched. 
slice() takes only 2 parameters — the first is the index at which to begin extraction, and the second is the index at which to stop extraction 
(extraction will occur up to, but not including the element at this index). 

let weatherConditions = ['rain', 'snow', 'sleet', 'hail', 'clear'];

let todaysWeather = weatherConditions.slice(1, 3);
// todaysWeather equals ['snow', 'sleet'];
// weatherConditions still equals ['rain', 'snow', 'sleet', 'hail', 'clear']

let thisArray = [true, true, undefined, false, null];
let thatArray = [...thisArray];
// thatArray equals [true, true, undefined, false, null]
// thisArray remains unchanged, and is identical to thatArray
------------------------------------
Combine Arrays with the Spread Operator
Another huge advantage of the spread operator, is the ability to combine arrays, or to insert all the elements of one array into another, at any index. 
With more traditional syntaxes, we can concatenate arrays, but this only allows us to combine arrays at the end of one, and at the start of another.

let thisArray = ['sage', 'rosemary', 'parsley', 'thyme'];

let thatArray = ['basil', 'cilantro', ...thisArray, 'coriander'];
// thatArray now equals ['basil', 'cilantro', 'sage', 'rosemary', 'parsley', 'thyme', 'coriander']
------------------------------------
Check For The Presence of an Element With indexOf()
indexOf() takes an element as a parameter, and when called, it returns the position, or index, of that element, or -1 if the element does not exist on the array.

let fruits = ['apples', 'pears', 'oranges', 'peaches', 'pears'];

fruits.indexOf('dates') // returns -1
fruits.indexOf('oranges') // returns 2
fruits.indexOf('pears') // returns 1, the first index at which the element exists


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Functions

functions
Function declaration:

function functionName() {
  console.log("Hello World");
}

If statements are used to make decisions in code. The keyword if tells JavaScript to execute the code in the curly braces under certain conditions, 
defined in the parentheses. These conditions are known as Boolean conditions and they may only be true or false.
-----------------------------------------
Equality operator
1 == 1 // true
1 == 2 // false
1 == '1' // true
"3" == 3 // returns true because JavaScript performs type conversion from string to number

Strict equality (===) 
However, unlike the equality operator, which attempts to convert both values being compared to a common type, 
the strict equality operator does not perform a type conversion.
3 === 3 // true
3 === '3' // returns false because the types are different and type conversion is not performed



In JavaScript, you can determine the type of a variable or a value with the typeof operator, as follows:
typeof 3 // returns 'number'
typeof '3' // returns 'string'


The inequality operator (!=) is the opposite of the equality operator. It means "Not Equal" and returns false where equality would return true and vice versa. 
Like the equality operator, the inequality operator will convert data types of values while comparing.
1 != 2 // true
1 != "1" // false
1 != '1' // false
1 != true // false
0 != false // false

The strict inequality operator (!==) is the logical opposite of the strict equality operator. 
It means "Strictly Not Equal" and returns false where strict equality would return true and vice versa. Strict inequality will not convert data types.
3 !== 3 // false
3 !== '3' // true
4 !== 3 // true


The greater than operator (>) compares the values of two numbers. If the number to the left is greater than the number to the right, 
it returns true. Otherwise, it returns false. Like the equality operator, greater than operator will convert data types of values while comparing.
5 > 3 // true
7 > '3' // true
2 > 3 // false
'1' > 9 // false

The greater than or equal to operator (>=) compares the values of two numbers. If the number to the left is greater than or equal to the number to the right, 
it returns true. Otherwise, it returns false. Like the equality operator, greater than or equal to operator will convert data types while comparing.
6 >= 6 // true
7 >= '3' // true
2 >= 3 // false
'7' >= 9 // false


The less than operator (<) compares the values of two numbers. If the number to the left is less than the number to the right, 
it returns true. Otherwise, it returns false. Like the equality operator, less than operator converts data types while comparing.
2 < 5 // true
'3' < 7 // true
5 < 5 // false
3 < 2 // false
'8' < 4 // false


The less than or equal to operator (<=) compares the values of two numbers. If the number to the left is less than or equal to the number to the right,
it returns true. If the number on the left is greater than the number on the right, it returns false. Like the equality operator, 
less than or equal to converts data types.
4 <= 5 // true
'7' <= 7 // true
5 <= 5 // true
3 <= 2 // false
'8' <= 4 // false

The logical and operator (&&) returns true if and only if the operands to the left and right of it are true.

The logical or operator (||) returns true if either of the operands is true. Otherwise, it returns false.
The logical or operator is composed of two pipe symbols (|). This can typically be found between your Backspace and Enter keys

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Objects
Objects are similar to arrays, except that instead of using indexes to access and modify their data, you access the data in objects through what are called properties.
Objects are useful for storing data in a structured way, and can represent real world objects, like a cat.
If your object has any non-string properties, JavaScript will automatically typecast them as strings.
var cat = {
  "name": "Whiskers",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "enemies": ["Water", "Dogs"]
};

There are two ways to access the properties of an object: dot notation (.) and bracket notation ([]), similar to an array.

Dot notation is what you use when you know the name of the property you're trying to access ahead of time.

The second way to access the properties of an object is bracket notation ([]). 
If the property of the object you are trying to access has a space in its name, you will need to use bracket notation.

var dogs = {
  Fido: "Mutt", Hunter: "Doberman", Snoopie: "Beagle"
};
var myDog = "Hunter";
var myBreed = dogs[myDog];
console.log(myBreed); // "Doberman"


var someObj = {
  propName: "John"
};
function propPrefix(str) {
  var s = "prop";
  return s + str;
}
var someProp = propPrefix("Name"); // someProp now holds the value 'propName'
console.log(someObj[someProp]); // "John"

After you've created a JavaScript object, you can update its properties at any time just like you would update any other variable. 
You can use either dot or bracket notation to update.
You can add new properties to existing JavaScript objects the same way you would modify them.
We can also delete properties from objects like this:
delete ourDog.bark;

Objects can be thought of as a key/value storage, like a dictionary. If you have tabular data, you can use an object to 
"lookup" values rather than a switch statement or an if/else chain. This is most useful when you know that your input data is limited to a certain range.
var alpha = {
  1:"Z",
  2:"Y",
  3:"X",
  4:"W",
  ...
  24:"C",
  25:"B",
  26:"A"
};
alpha[2]; // "Y"
alpha[24]; // "C"

var value = 2;
alpha[value]; // "Y"

Sometimes it is useful to check if the property of a given object exists or not. We can use the .hasOwnProperty(propname) method of 
objects to determine if that object has the given property name..hasOwnProperty() returns true or false if the property is found or not.
var myObj = {
  top: "hat",
  bottom: "pants"
};
myObj.hasOwnProperty("top"); // true
myObj.hasOwnProperty("middle"); // false

Sometimes you may want to store data in a flexible Data Structure. A JavaScript object is one way to handle flexible data. 
They allow for arbitrary combinations of strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, functions, and objects.
var ourMusic = [
  {
    "artist": "Daft Punk",
    "title": "Homework",
    "release_year": 1997,
    "formats": [
      "CD",
      "Cassette",
      "LP"
    ],
    "gold": true
  }
];

JavaScript Object Notation or JSON is a related data interchange format used to store data

The sub-properties of objects can be accessed by chaining together the dot or bracket notation.
var ourStorage = {
  "desk": {
    "drawer": "stapler"
  },
  "cabinet": {
    "top drawer": {
      "folder1": "a file",
      "folder2": "secrets"
    },
    "bottom drawer": "soda"
  }
};
ourStorage.cabinet["top drawer"].folder2; // "secrets"
ourStorage.desk.drawer; // "stapler"

Create empty array inside object:
collection[id].tracks = [""];




for(var j = 0; j < contacts.length; j++) {
        if(contacts[name][j] == prop) {
            return contacts[name][j];
        }
    }
        return "No such property";

At their most basic, objects are just collections of key-value pairs, or in other words, pieces of data mapped to unique identifiers that we call properties or keys.
---------------------------
Constructor
Constructors are functions that create new objects. They define properties and behaviors that will belong to the new object. 

Constructors are functions that create new objects. They define properties and behaviors that will belong to the new object.

function Bird() {
  this.name = "Albert";
  this.color = "blue";
  this.numLegs = 2;
}

Constructors follow a few conventions:

Constructors are defined with a capitalized name to distinguish them from other functions that are not constructors.
Constructors use the keyword this to set properties of the object they will create. Inside the constructor, this refers to the new object it will create.
Constructors define properties and behaviors instead of returning a value as other functions might.

let blueBird = new Bird();
new operator is used when calling a constructor. This tells JavaScript to create a new instance of Bird called blueBird. 
Without the new operator, this inside the constructor would not point to the newly created object, giving unexpected results.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Change the Prototype to a New Object
Bird.prototype = {
  numLegs: 2,
  eat: function() {
    console.log("nom nom nom");
  },
  describe: function() {
    console.log("My name is " + this.name);
  }
};

There is one crucial side effect of manually setting the prototype to a new object. It erased the constructor property!

console.log(duck.constructor)
// prints ‘undefined’ - Oops!
To fix this, whenever a prototype is manually set to a new object

Bird.prototype = {
  constructor: Bird, // define the constructor property
  numLegs: 2,
  eat: function() {
    console.log("nom nom nom");
  },
  describe: function() {
    console.log("My name is " + this.name);
  }
};

----------------
Just like people inherit genes from their parents, an object inherits its prototype directly from the constructor function that created it.
function Bird(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

let duck = new Bird("Donald");
Bird.prototype.isPrototypeOf(duck);
--------------
Prototype Chain
All objects in JavaScript (with a few exceptions) have a prototype. Also, an object’s prototype itself is an object.

    function Bird(name) {
      this.name = name;
    }

    typeof Bird.prototype; // => object

Because a prototype is an object, a prototype can have its own prototype! In this case, the prototype of Bird.prototype is Object.prototype
Object.prototype.isPrototypeOf(Bird.prototype);
// returns true

let duck = new Bird("Donald");
duck.hasOwnProperty("name"); // => true
 
The hasOwnProperty method is defined in Object.prototype, which can be accessed by Bird.prototype, which can then be accessed by duck.
In this prototype chain, Bird is the supertype for duck, while duck is the subtype. Object is a supertype for both Bird and duck.
Object is a supertype for all objects in JavaScript. Therefore, any object can use the hasOwnProperty method.
---------------
inheritance
Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)
Bird.prototype = {
  constructor: Bird,
  describe: function() {
    console.log("My name is " + this.name);
  }
};

Dog.prototype = {
  constructor: Dog,
  describe: function() {
    console.log("My name is " + this.name);
  }
}

function Animal() { };

Animal.prototype = {
  constructor: Animal,
  describe: function() {
    console.log("My name is " + this.name);
  }
};

Bird.prototype = {
  constructor: Bird
};

Dog.prototype = {
  constructor: Dog
};

let animal = Object.create(Animal.prototype); //better then let animal = new Animal(); for inheritance
Object.create(obj) creates a new object, and sets obj as the new object's prototype. Recall that the prototype is like the "recipe" for creating an object. 
By setting the prototype of animal to be Animal's prototype, you are effectively giving the animal instance the same "recipe" as any other instance of Animal.

animal.eat(); // prints "nom nom nom"
animal instanceof Animal; // => true

Set the Child's Prototype to an Instance of the Parent
Bird.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype);

the recipe for Bird now includes all the key "ingredients" from Animal. duck inherits all of Animal's properties, including the eat method.
let duck = new Bird("Donald");
duck.eat(); // prints "nom nom nom"

Reset an Inherited Constructor Property
function Bird() { }
Bird.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype);
let duck = new Bird();
duck.constructor // function Animal(){...}
Bird.prototype.constructor = Bird;
duck.constructor // function Bird(){...}

A constructor function that inherits its prototype object from a supertype constructor function can still have its own methods in addition to inherited methods.
Bird.prototype.fly = function() {
  console.log("I'm flying!");
};
----
Override Inherited Methods
function Animal() { }
Animal.prototype.eat = function() {
  return "nom nom nom";
};
function Bird() { }

// Inherit all methods from Animal
Bird.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype);

// Bird.eat() overrides Animal.eat()
Bird.prototype.eat = function() {
  return "peck peck peck";
};

If you have an instance let duck = new Bird(); and you call duck.eat(), this is how JavaScript looks for the method on duck’s prototype chain:

1. duck => Is eat() defined here? No.

2. Bird => Is eat() defined here? => Yes. Execute it and stop searching.

3. Animal => eat() is also defined, but JavaScript stopped searching before reaching this level.

4. Object => JavaScript stopped searching before reaching this level.
----------
Mixin
For unrelated objects, it's better to use mixins. A mixin allows other objects to use a collection of functions.
let flyMixin = function(obj) {
  obj.fly = function() {
    console.log("Flying, wooosh!");
  }
};
The flyMixin takes any object and gives it the fly method.
let bird = {
  name: "Donald",
  numLegs: 2
};

let plane = {
  model: "777",
  numPassengers: 524
};

flyMixin(bird);
flyMixin(plane);
bird.fly(); // prints "Flying, wooosh!"
plane.fly(); // prints "Flying, wooosh!"
-----------
Closure
to Protect Properties Within an Object from Being Modified Externally

The simplest way to make properties private is by creating a variable within the constructor function. 
This changes the scope of that variable to be within the constructor function versus available globally. 
This way, the property can only be accessed and changed by methods also within the constructor function.

function Bird() {
  let hatchedEgg = 10; // private property

  this.getHatchedEggCount = function() { // publicly available method that a bird object can use
    return hatchedEgg;
  };
}
let ducky = new Bird();
ducky.getHatchedEggCount(); // returns 10

Here getHachedEggCount is a privileged method, because it has access to the private variable hatchedEgg. 
This is possible because hatchedEgg is declared in the same context as getHachedEggCount. 
In JavaScript, a function always has access to the context in which it was created. This is called closure.
-------
Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE)
A common pattern in JavaScript is to execute a function as soon as it is declared:
(function () {
  console.log("Chirp, chirp!");
})(); // this is an anonymous function expression that executes right away
// Outputs "Chirp, chirp!" immediately

function has no name and is not stored in a variable. The two parentheses () at the end of the function expression cause it to be immediately executed or invoked. 

Use an IIFE to Create a Module
An immediately invoked function expression (IIFE) is often used to group related functionality into a single object or module

let motionModule = (function () {
  return {
    glideMixin: function (obj) {
      obj.glide = function() {
        console.log("Gliding on the water");
      };
    },
    flyMixin: function(obj) {
      obj.fly = function() {
        console.log("Flying, wooosh!");
      };
    }
  }
}) (); // The two parentheses cause the function to be immediately invoked

you have an immediately invoked function expression (IIFE) that returns an object motionModule. This returned object contains all of the mixin behaviors as properties of the object.
The advantage of the module pattern is that all of the motion behaviors can be packaged into a single object that can then be used by other parts of your code. 
motionModule.glideMixin(duck);
duck.glide();

let funModule = ( function() {
  return {
      isCuteMixin: function(obj) {
      obj.isCute = function() {
        return true;
      };
    },
    singMixin: function(obj) {
      obj.sing = function() {
        console.log("Singing to an awesome tune");
      };
    }
  }
}) ();

instanceof
allows you to compare an object to a constructor, returning true or false based on whether or not that object was created with the constructor.

let Bird = function(name, color) {
  this.name = name;
  this.color = color;
  this.numLegs = 2;
}

let crow = new Bird("Alexis", "black");

crow instanceof Bird; // => true
----------------
function Bird(name) {
  this.name = name;
  this.numLegs = 2;
}

let duck = new Bird("Donald");
let canary = new Bird("Tweety");

name and numLegs are called own properties, because they are defined directly on the instance object. 
That means that duck and canary each has its own separate copy of these properties.

let ownProps = [];

for (let property in duck) {
  if(duck.hasOwnProperty(property)) {
    ownProps.push(property);
  }
}

console.log(ownProps); // prints [ "name", "numLegs" ]
------------
The prototype is an object that is shared among ALL instances of Bird.
Bird.prototype.numLegs = 2;
Since all instances automatically have the properties on the prototype, think of a prototype as a "recipe" for creating objects.
Nearly every object in JavaScript has a prototype property which is part of the constructor function that created it.
-----------
Own properties are defined directly on the object instance itself. And prototype properties are defined on the prototype

function Bird(name) {
  this.name = name; //own property
}

Bird.prototype.numLegs = 2; // prototype property

let duck = new Bird("Donald");
----------
Constructor Property
constructor property is a reference to the constructor function that created the instance.
 
let duck = new Bird();
let beagle = new Dog();

console.log(duck.constructor === Bird); //prints true
console.log(beagle.constructor === Dog); //prints true

Since the constructor property can be overwritten it’s generally better to use the instanceof method to check the type of an object.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
rand
    Use Math.random() to generate a random decimal.
    Multiply that random decimal by 20.
    Use another function, Math.floor() to round the number down to its nearest whole number.

Remember that Math.random() can never quite return a 1 and, because we're rounding down, it's impossible to actually get 20. 
This technique will give us a whole number between 0 and 19.

Instead of generating a random number between zero and a given number like we did before, we can generate a random number that falls within a range of two specific numbers.
Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min + 1)) + min
----------------------------------------------------------------
parsers
var a = parseInt("007");  If the first character in the string can't be converted into a number, then it returns NaN.

The parseInt() function parses a string and returns an integer. It takes a second argument for the radix, which specifies the base of the number in the string. The radix can be an integer between 2 and 36.

The function call looks like:

parseInt(string, radix);

And here's an example:

var a = parseInt("11", 2);

The radix variable says that "11" is in the binary system, or base 2. This example converts the string "11" to an integer 3.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ES6
let
override declaration
	var camper = 'James';
	var camper = 'David';
	console.log(camper);
	// logs 'David'
don't override declaration
	let camper = 'James';
	let camper = 'David'; // throws an error
	
"use strict". 
	This enables Strict Mode, which catches common coding mistakes and "unsafe" actions.	
	
	
When you declare a variable with the var keyword, it is declared globally, or locally if declared inside a function.
The let keyword behaves similarly, but with some extra features. When you declare a variable with the let keyword inside a block, statement, 
or expression, its scope is limited to that block, statement, or expression.

'use strict';
let printNumTwo;
for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  if (i === 2) {
    printNumTwo = function() {
      return i;
    };
  }
}
console.log(printNumTwo());
// returns 2
console.log(i);
// returns "i is not defined"
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

const
as all the features that let has
variables declared using const are read-only
They are a constant value, which means that once a variable is assigned with const, it cannot be reassigned.
A common practice when naming constants is to use all uppercase letters, with words separated by an underscore.

assigned to a variable using const are still mutable. Using the const declaration only prevents reassignment of the variable identifier.

"use strict";
const s = [5, 6, 7];
s = [1, 2, 3]; // throws error, trying to assign a const
s[2] = 45; // works just as it would with an array declared with var or let
console.log(s); // returns [5, 6, 45]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To ensure your data doesn't change, JavaScript provides a function Object.freeze to prevent data mutation.
Once the object is frozen, you can no longer add, update, or delete properties from it. Any attempt at changing the object will be rejected without an error.

let obj = {
  name:"FreeCodeCamp",
  review:"Awesome"
};
Object.freeze(obj);
obj.review = "bad"; //will be ignored. Mutation not allowed
obj.newProp = "Test"; // will be ignored. Mutation not allowed
console.log(obj);
// { name: "FreeCodeCamp", review:"Awesome"}
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Arrow Functions
In JavaScript, we often don't need to name our functions, especially when passing a function as an argument to another function. Instead, we create inline functions. 
We don't need to name these functions because we do not reuse them anywhere else.

const myFunc = function() {
  const myVar = "value";
  return myVar;
}

ES6 provides us with the syntactic sugar to not have to write anonymous functions this way. Instead, you can use arrow function syntax:

const myFunc = () => {
  const myVar = "value";
  return myVar;
}
When there is no function body, and only a return value, arrow function syntax allows you to omit the keyword return as well as the brackets surrounding the code. 
This helps simplify smaller functions into one-line statements:

const myFunc = () => "value"
This code will still return value by default.

// doubles input value and returns it
const doubler = (item) => item * 2;

Arrow functions work really well with higher order functions, such as map(), filter(), and reduce(), that take other functions as arguments for processing collections of data.

FBPosts.filter((post) => post.thumbnail !== null && post.shares > 100 && post.likes > 500)


const realNumberArray = [4, 5.6, -9.8, 3.14, 42, 6, 8.34, -2];
const squareList = (arr) => {
  "use strict";
  // change code below this line
  const squaredIntegers = arr.filter(element => element > 0 && (element % parseInt(element) === 0)).map(element => Math.pow(element,2));
  // change code above this line
  return squaredIntegers;
};
// test your code
const squaredIntegers = squareList(realNumberArray);
console.log(squaredIntegers);
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
default parameters for functions
The default parameter kicks in when the argument is not specified (it is undefined)

function greeting(name = "Anonymous") {
  return "Hello " + name;
}
console.log(greeting("John")); // Hello John
console.log(greeting()); // Hello Anonymous
---------------------

rest operator for function parameters
With the rest operator, you can create functions that take a variable number of arguments. 
These arguments are stored in an array that can be accessed later from inside the function.
The rest operator eliminates the need to check the args array and allows us to apply map(), filter() and reduce() on the parameters array.

function howMany(...args) {
  return "You have passed " + args.length + " arguments.";
}
console.log(howMany(0, 1, 2)); // You have passed 3 arguments
console.log(howMany("string", null, [1, 2, 3], { })); // You have passed 4 arguments.
---------------
spread operator
allows us to expand arrays and other expressions in places where multiple parameters or elements are expected.

var arr = [6, 89, 3, 45];
var maximus = Math.max.apply(null, arr); // returns 89

const arr = [6, 89, 3, 45];
const maximus = Math.max(...arr);

...arr returns an unpacked array. In other words, it spreads the array.
However, the spread operator only works in-place, like in an argument to a function or in an array literal.

Copy array:
	arr2 = [...arr1];
------------------------------------------------------------

Destructuring Assignment to Assign Variables from Arrays
One key difference between the spread operator and array destructuring is that the spread operator unpacks all contents of an array into a comma-separated list. 
Consequently, you cannot pick or choose which elements you want to assign to variables.

const [a, b] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
console.log(a, b); // 1, 2

const [a, b,,, c] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
console.log(a, b, c); // 1, 2, 5 

[a,b] = [b, a]

const [a, b, ...arr] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7];
console.log(a, b); // 1, 2
console.log(arr); // [3, 4, 5, 7]   		similar Array.prototype.slice()

----------------------------------------------------------
Destructuring Assignment to Pass an Object as a Function's Parameters

const profileUpdate = (profileData) => {
  const { name, age, nationality, location } = profileData;
  // do something with these variables
}

const profileUpdate = ({ name, age, nationality, location }) => {
  /* do something with these fields */
}


const stats = {
  max: 56.78,
  standard_deviation: 4.34,
  median: 34.54,
  mode: 23.87,
  min: -0.75,
  average: 35.85
};
const half = (function() {
  "use strict"; // do not change this line

  // change code below this line
  return function half({max, min}) {
    // use function argument destructuring
    return (max + min) / 2.0;
  };
  // change code above this line

})();
---------------------------------------------------------
Template Literals
Template literals allow you to create multi-line strings and to use string interpolation features to create strings.
const person = {
  name: "Zodiac Hasbro",
  age: 56
};

// Template literal with multi-line and string interpolation
const greeting = `Hello, my name is ${person.name}!
I am ${person.age} years old.`;

console.log(greeting); // prints
// Hello, my name is Zodiac Hasbro!
// I am 56 years old.
Firstly, the example uses backticks (`), not quotes (' or "), to wrap the string.
Secondly, notice that the string is multi-line, both in the code and the output. This saves inserting \n within strings.
The ${variable} syntax used above is a placeholder. Basically, you won't have to use concatenation with the + operator anymore. 
To add variables to strings, you just drop the variable in a template string and wrap it with ${ and }. Similarly, you can include other expressions in your string 
literal, for example ${a + b}.

[`<li class="text-warning">${arr[0]}</li>`, `<li class="text-warning">${arr[1]}</li>` ,`<li class="text-warning">${arr[2]}</li>`];
--------------------------------------------------------
Simple Fields

const getMousePosition = (x, y) => ({
  x: x,
  y: y
});

rewritten to use this new syntax:
const getMousePosition = (x, y) => ({ x, y });
--------------------------------------------------------
Class

class syntax is just a syntax, and not a full-fledged class based implementation of object oriented paradigm, unlike in languages like Java, or Python, or Ruby etc.

var SpaceShuttle = function(targetPlanet){
  this.targetPlanet = targetPlanet;
}
var zeus = new SpaceShuttle('Jupiter');

class SpaceShuttle {
  constructor(targetPlanet){
    this.targetPlanet = targetPlanet;
  }
}
const zeus = new SpaceShuttle('Jupiter');

class keyword declares a new function, and a constructor was added, which would be invoked when new is called - to create a new object.

function makeClass() {
  "use strict";
  /* Alter code below this line */
  class Vegetable{
    constructor(name){
      this.name = name;
    }
  }
  /* Alter code above this line */
  return Vegetable;
}
const Vegetable = makeClass();
const carrot = new Vegetable('carrot');
console.log(carrot.name); // => should be 'carrot'



getters and setters
Getter functions are meant to simply return (get) the value of an object's private variable to the user without the user directly accessing the private variable.

Setter functions are meant to modify (set) the value of an object's private variable based on the value passed into the setter function. 
This change could involve calculations, or even overwriting the previous value completely.

class Book {
  constructor(author) {
    this._author = author;
  }
  // getter
  get writer(){
    return this._author;
  }
  // setter
  set writer(updatedAuthor){
    this._author = updatedAuthor;
  }
}
const lol = new Book('anonymous');
console.log(lol.writer);  // anonymous
lol.writer = 'wut';
console.log(lol.writer);  // wut
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
import and require

import { countItems } from "math_array_functions"

import { function } from "file_path_goes_here"
// We can also import variables the same way!

The whitespace surrounding the function inside the curly braces is a best practice - it makes it easier to read the import statement.
In most cases, the file path requires a ./ before it; otherwise, node will look in the node_modules directory first trying to load it as a dependency.

---------
export

const capitalizeString = (string) => {
  return string.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + string.slice(1);
}
export { capitalizeString } //How to export functions.
export const foo = "bar"; //How to export variables.

if you would like to compact all your export statements into one line, you can take this approach:
const capitalizeString = (string) => {
  return string.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + string.slice(1);
}
const foo = "bar";
export { capitalizeString, foo }
-------------------
export default

export default function add(x,y) {
  return x + y;
}

Since export default is used to declare a fallback value for a module or file, you can only have one value be a default export in each module or file. 
Additionally, you cannot use export default with var, let, or const
-----------------------

Import Everything from a File
import * as myMathModule from "math_functions";

import * as object_with_name_of_your_choice from "file_path_goes_here"
object_with_name_of_your_choice.imported_function

You may use any name following the import * as portion of the statement. In order to utilize this method, it requires an object that receives the imported values.
From here, you will use the dot notation to call your imported values.
-------------------------------------------
import a default export

import add from "math_functions";
add(5,4); //Will return 9

The syntax differs in one key place - the imported value, add, is not surrounded by curly braces, {}. Unlike exported values, the primary method of importing a default 
export is to simply write the value's name after import.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
for (let user in users) {
  console.log(user);
};

Functional programming is an approach to software development based around the evaluation of functions. 
Functional programming follows a few core principles:
    Functions are independent from the state of the program or global variables. They only depend on the arguments passed into them to make a calculation

    Functions try to limit any changes to the state of the program and avoid changes to the global objects holding data

    Functions have minimal side effects in the program
	
INPUT -> PROCESS -> OUTPUT

1) Isolated functions - there is no dependence on the state of the program, which includes global variables that are subject to change

2) Pure functions - the same input always gives the same output

3) Functions with limited side effects - any changes, or mutations, to the state of the program outside the function are carefully controlled


Callbacks are the functions that are slipped or passed into another function to decide the invocation of that function. 
You may have seen them passed to other methods, for example in filter, the callback function tells JavaScript the criteria for how to filter an array.

Functions that can be assigned to a variable, passed into another function, or returned from another function just like any other normal value, 
are called first class functions. In JavaScript, all functions are first class functions.

The functions that take a function as an argument, or return a function as a return value are called higher order functions.

When the functions are passed in to another function or returned from another function, then those functions which gets passed in or returned can be called a lambda.

Recall that in functional programming, changing or altering things is called mutation, and the outcome is called a side effect. 
A function, ideally, should be a pure function, meaning that it does not cause any side effects.

// the global Array
var s = [23, 65, 98, 5];

Array.prototype.myMap = function(callback){
  var newArray = [];
  // Add your code below this line
  this.forEach(a => newArray.push(callback(a)))
  // Add your code above this line
  return newArray;

};

var new_s = s.myMap(function(item){
  return item * 2;
});

console.log(s)
console.log(new_s)

Array.prototype.filter()
The filter method returns a new array which is at most as long as the original array, but usually has fewer items.

// Add your code below this line

var filteredList = watchList.map((item) => ({
  "title":item["Title"], "rating":item["imdbRating"]
})).filter(item => item.rating >= 8.0);
var ff = filteredList.filter(item => item.rating >= 8.0)
// Add your code above this line

console.log(filteredList); 
filteredList.forEach(a => console.log(a.title + ":" + a.rating))
ff.forEach(a => console.log(a.title + ":" + a.rating))

//implement filter
// the global Array
var s = [23, 65, 98, 5];

Array.prototype.myFilter = function(callback){
  var newArray = [];
  // Add your code below this line
  this.forEach(item => 
    callback(item) === true?
      newArray.push(item):false)
  // Add your code above this line
  return newArray;

};

var new_s = s.myFilter(function(item){
  return item % 2 === 1;
});
console.log(new_s)


The slice method returns a copy of certain elements of an array. It can take two arguments, the first gives the index of where to begin the slice, 
the second is the index for where to end the slice (and it's non-inclusive). If the arguments are not provided, the default is to start at the beginning 
of the array through the end, which is an easy way to make a copy of the entire array. The slice method does not mutate the original array, but returns a new one.

---------------
Concatenation means to join items end to end. JavaScript offers the concat method for both strings and arrays that work in the same way. 
For arrays, the method is called on one, then another array is provided as the argument to concat, which is added to the end of the first array. 
It returns a new array and does not mutate either of the original arrays.

[1, 2, 3].concat([4, 5, 6]);
// Returns a new array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
----------------
Array.prototype.reduce()

var ff = watchList.filter(x => x["Director"]==="Christopher Nolan").map(x => Number(x.imdbRating))
var l = watchList.filter(x => x["Director"]==="Christopher Nolan").length
var averageRating = ff.reduce((x1,x2) => x1 + x2) /l;
// Add your code above this line

console.log(averageRating); 
console.log(ff); 
console.log(l)
-------------
always declare your dependencies explicitly. 
This means if a function depends on a variable or object being present, then pass that variable or object directly into the function as an argument.
There are several good consequences from this principle. The function is easier to test, you know exactly what input it takes, 
and it won't depend on anything else in your program.
This can give you more confidence when you alter, remove, or add new code. You would know what you can or cannot change 
and you can see where the potential traps are.
Finally, the function would always produce the same output for the same set of inputs, no matter what part of the code executes it.

*****************************************************************************************************************************************************

Refactor (rewrite) the code so the global array bookList is not changed inside either function. The add function should add the 
given bookName to the end of an array. The remove function should remove the given bookName from an array. Both functions should return an array, 
and any new parameters should be added before the bookName one.




// the global variable
var bookList = ["The Hound of the Baskervilles", "On The Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies", "Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica", "Disquisitiones Arithmeticae"];

/* This function should add a book to the list and return the list */
// New parameters should come before the bookName one

// Add your code below this line
function add (arr, bookName) {
  let resultList  = arr.slice()
  resultList.push(bookName);
  console.log(resultList)
  return resultList;
  // Add your code above this line
}

/* This function should remove a book from the list and return the list */
// New parameters should come before the bookName one

// Add your code below this line
function remove (arr, bookName) {
  if (arr.indexOf(bookName) >= 0) {
    let resultArr = arr.slice() 
    //console.log(resultArr)
   // console.log(bookName)
    //console.log(resultArr.indexOf(bookName))
    resultArr.splice(resultArr.indexOf(bookName), 1);
    return resultArr;
    
    // Add your code above this line
    }
}

var newBookList = add(bookList, 'A Brief History of Time');
var newerBookList = remove(bookList, 'On The Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies');
var newestBookList = remove(add(bookList, 'A Brief History of Time'), 'On The Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies');

//console.log(bookList);
//console.log(newBookList);
//console.log(newerBookList);
console.log(newestBookList);

It would make sense to be able to pass them as arguments to other functions, and return a function from another function. 
Functions are considered First Class Objects in JavaScript, which means they can be used like any other object. 
They can be saved in variables, stored in an object, or passed as function arguments.
*************************************************
var rating = [];

  rating = watchList.map((item) => (
    {"title": item["Title"],
    "rating": item["imdbRating"]}
  ))
**************************************************
------------------------------------------------------
The sort method sorts the elements of an array according to the callback function.
function ascendingOrder(arr) {
  return arr.sort(function(a, b) {
    return a - b;
  });
}
ascendingOrder([1, 5, 2, 3, 4]);
// Returns [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

function reverseAlpha(arr) {
  return arr.sort(function(a, b) {
    return a < b;
  });
}
reverseAlpha(['l', 'h', 'z', 'b', 's']);
// Returns ['z', 's', 'l', 'h', 'b']

-----------------------------------------------------
The split method splits a string into an array of strings. It takes an argument for the delimiter, which can be a character 
to use to break up the string or a regular expression.

var str = "Hello World";
var bySpace = str.split(" ");
// Sets bySpace to ["Hello", "World"]

var otherString = "How9are7you2today";
var byDigits = otherString.split(/\d
----------------------------------------------------
The join method is used to join the elements of an array together to create a string. 
It takes an argument for the delimiter that is used to separate the array elements in the string.

var arr = ["Hello", "World"];
var str = arr.join(" ");
// Sets str to "Hello World"
----------------------------------------------------
The every method works with arrays to check if every element passes a particular test. It returns a Boolean value - true if all values meet the criteria, false if not.

var numbers = [1, 5, 8, 0, 10, 11];
numbers.every(function(currentValue) {
  return currentValue < 10;
});
// Returns false
---------------------------------------------------
The some method works with arrays to check if any element passes a particular test. It returns a Boolean value - true if any of the values meet the criteria, false if not.

var numbers = [10, 50, 8, 220, 110, 11];
numbers.some(function(currentValue) {
  return currentValue < 10;
});
// Returns true
-------------------------------------------------
Currying and Partial Application
The arity of a function is the number of arguments it requires. Currying a function means to convert a function of N arity into N functions of arity 1.
In other words, it restructures a function so it takes one argument, then returns another function that takes the next argument, and so on.

//Un-curried function
function unCurried(x, y) {
  return x + y;
}

//Curried function
function curried(x) {
  return function(y) {
    return x + y;
  }
}
curried(1)(2) // Returns 3
This is useful in your program if you can't supply all the arguments to a function at one time. You can save each function call into a variable,
which will hold the returned function reference that takes the next argument when it's available. 

// Call a curried function in parts:
var funcForY = curried(1);
console.log(funcForY(2)); // Prints 3

partial application can be described as applying a few arguments to a function at a time and returning another function that is applied to more arguments.

//Impartial function
function impartial(x, y, z) {
  return x + y + z;
}
var partialFn = impartial.bind(this, 1, 2);
partialFn(10); // Returns 13
